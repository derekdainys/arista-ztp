Different ideas for building scalable solutions for zero touch provisioning process.

There are couple things I dislike specifically around the idea of manipulating dhcp as it is quite manual or as I like to call up-front-provisioning.
This process usually involves identifying devices based on serial number or system MAC address and handing them the right configuration file.
